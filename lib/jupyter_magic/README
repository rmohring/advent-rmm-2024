The pathsetup_line_magic.py file is not meant as a module...

However, if you copy it to your local .ipython folder under:

$HOME/.ipython/profile_default/startup

...it will enable a line magic in jupyterlab that will set up the system PYTHONPATH for you automatically.

Note that it requires the `gitpython` package to be installed.

To add only the git repository root directory, just do:
%pathsetup

To add the repository root as well as specific subdirectories:
%pathsetup folder1 [folder2 ...]
